## Resume rule

A resumed stream must verify this tracker against Git history, the exact worktree and Neon branch. Git history is authoritative when a stale tracker conflicts with committed evidence; the agent must correct the tracker before continuing. It must resume from the first incomplete milestone, not replay completed milestones.

## Program completion rule

Only `INTEG-01` may mark `GATE-PILOT-READY` passed, and only after all required streams are integrated, migrations/recovery are rehearsed, critical tests pass and a pilot-ready report is committed. Module completion never equals program completion.
